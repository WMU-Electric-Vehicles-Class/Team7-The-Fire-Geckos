# Project Halfway Report Update 

## The code for the halfway project can be found in the Project_half folder, this contains the code that we used to obtain the necessary plots for the component modelling section. Our project contains modelling and analysis of a Formula E vehicle.

## It is difficult to find specific details and component specifications for this vehicle so we decided to use vehicles that are either similar to the Formula E or simulated, the vehicle based on values found through websites and papers. 

## For the final project, we have included all the vehicle subsytems. The battery, transmission (from the F-SAE vehicle), motor, and power electronics. The efficeincy motor maps were obtained from the Audi ETron as information for the Speed, Torque and Efficiency was available online.
